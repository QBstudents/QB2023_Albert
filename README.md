# Quantitative Biodiversity, Spring 2023, Indiana University
Lauren Albert, laalber@iu.edu
Hello! I am Lauren, a second year student in Spencer Hall's lab. I study how stage-structure effects the community ecology of disease, especially interested in size structure and community interactions. To address my questions, I work with small aquatic organisms known as Daphnia which exist in fresh water lakes. Here, they eat algae, I love algae and how beautiful it is. Before I worked with Daphnia, I worked with birds so the transition was quite drastic. I still enjoy going to find birds and observe other creatures. A lot of these observations inspire artwork that I create through printmaking, soundscapes, and other media projects. 

Course expectations:
1. Have a foundational understanding of biodiversity and the crossover to questions I am pursuing. 
2. Become proficient in using git and github to organize my past, current, and future projects
3. Be able to explain these tools to others
